# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline With GCP Vertex AI Workbench

This repository includes end-to-end pipeline for:
* testing your notebooks
* training your model
* deploying to the prediction

The goal of this repository is to showcase what can be built using notebook-centric development practices, and we aim for it to be a reference implementation for those who want to develop similar systems on Google Cloud.
